## Lab 06 - Launch Phishing Simulation Campaigns. 

## Lab scenario

Phishing Simulation Campaigns in Microsoft 365 Defender involve creating fake phishing emails to test and educate users. These campaigns mimic real attacks, evaluating users' responses to improve their awareness. They're set up by crafting realistic emails, sent to targeted groups, and monitored for user interactions. Reports are generated to analyze user behavior and provide immediate feedback for learning. Continuous analysis helps adapt training to enhance security awareness, strengthening defenses against actual phishing threats.
