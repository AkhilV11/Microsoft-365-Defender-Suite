# SIEM with Microsoft Sentinel 

## Overview

Microsoft Sentinel is a powerful tool for collecting, analyzing, and responding to security data, while threat hunting is a proactive approach that complements automated security measures by actively searching for hidden threats. Together, they form a comprehensive strategy to enhance an organization's cybersecurity posture and protect against a wide range of threats.

### Key features of Microsoft Sentinel

- Log Collection: Microsoft Sentinel collects and centralizes log data from a wide range of sources, including servers, applications, devices, and cloud services.
- Threat Detection: It uses built-in and custom detection rules to identify suspicious activities and security threats in real time.
- Incident Investigation: Security analysts can use Microsoft Sentinel to investigate incidents, analyze logs, and visualize the scope of security threats.
- Automation: Sentinel offers automation capabilities to respond to common security incidents and orchestrate complex security workflows.
- Threat Intelligence: It integrates with threat intelligence feeds to enrich data and improve threat detection.
Integration: Microsoft Sentinel seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft security solutions and third-party tools.

## Sandbox Scenario
Contoso is a global organization with a complex IT infrastructure that includes a combination of on-premises data centers and cloud-based resources. They are looking to enhance their security posture by deploying Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automation and response (SOAR) solution. Additionally, Contoso aims to onboard its cloud resources and servers to Azure Sentinel to gain better visibility and proactive threat detection and response capabilities.

By implementing a robust log analytics and threat detection program, Contoso aims to proactively identify and mitigate threats, reduce the risk of security breaches, and maintain a strong security posture in an ever-evolving threat landscape. This approach will enable Contoso to stay ahead of potential threats and protect its digital assets effectively.
