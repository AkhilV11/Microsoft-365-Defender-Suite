>**Warning:** The simulations and tutorials here are an excellent source of learning through practice.  Simulations and tutorials are being added and edited regularly in the portal.  However, some of these simulations & tutorials may interfere with the performance of the labs designed for this training course.  Only perform the simulations and tutorials recommended in the instructions provided for this lab when using the course provided Azure tenant.  You may perform the other simulations and tutorials *after* this training course is complete with this tenant.
