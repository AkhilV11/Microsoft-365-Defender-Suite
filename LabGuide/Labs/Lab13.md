## Lab 13 - Deploy Domain Controller 

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you will install Active Directory Domain Services on a pre-configured virtual machine and add 'Active Directory Domain Services' as a role, and promote the server to a domain controller. They specify domain details, set a DSRM password, configure default settings, and review options before installing. The process concludes with a successful prerequisites check, ensuring a streamlined installation of Active Directory.<br>
<br>To fully implement and benefit from Defender for Identity capabilities, one of the prerequisites is configuring the server as a domain controller. This configuration allows Defender for Identity to monitor and analyze the identity-related activities, behaviors, and potential threats within the domain environment, providing insights and enhancing security measures specifically related to user identities and authentication protocols.

## Lab objectives (Duration: minutes)

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Exercise 1.1: Configure VM with Static IP Addresses
- Exercise 1.2: Install Active Directory Domain Services

## Architecture Diagram

### Exercise 1: Deploy Domain Controller 

#### Task 1.1 : Configure VM with Static IP Addresses

Domain controllers need a static IP address and the DNS pointing to itself. For on-premises DCs you would just go into the NIC settings and manually configure the IP settings. With Azure VMs itâ€™s recommended to set this at the Virtual Network Interface.

1. Go to **svm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /></inject>** virtual machine. In the left-hand menu for your VM under settings click on **Networking**.Now click on the Network Interface for the VM **svm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /></inject>-nic**.

2. Click on **IP Configurations** in the left menu under settings. Next click on **ipconfig1** under IP configurations.

3. Change the IP from **Dynamic** to **Static** and enter the IP address you want the domain controller to have, it must be an IP from the subnet you assigned to your virtual network like 10.0.0.4. Click **Save**.

4. Go back to the Network Interface and click on **DNS servers**. Set the DNS server to the IP address of the domain controller.

#### Task 1.2 : Install Active Directory Domain Services

A Domain Controller (DC) is a vital component in a Windows-based network that manages security, authentication, and access control. It runs the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role, storing user account information, authenticating user logins, managing permissions, and organizing network resources. Essentially, it acts as a centralized hub, controlling and coordinating access to the network's resources, ensuring security, and enforcing policies across the domain.

1. From the jump VM. Search for **Server Manager** from the start menu and select it. Go to the server manager and click on **Add roles and features**.

5. Under **Server Roles** tab, select **Active Directory Domain Services**. You will get a pop-up to add additional features. Click **Add Features** then Click **Next**.

7. From the **Active Directory Domain Service** tab, Click **Next**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/dc8.png)

8. In the **Confirm installation selections** tab, Click **Install**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/dc9.png)

9. When finished click the flag icon in the upper right corner and click on **Promote this server to a domain controller**.

10. Now a new tab will open of Deployment configuration. Click on **Add a new forest**. Under **Root domain name** provide the domain name **contoso.com**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/dcnew1.png)

11. Under **Domain Controller Options** tab, keep the default settings and provide a DSRM password and click **Next**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/dc12.png)

>**Note**: Keep the DSRM password in a notepad. You will be needing DSRM password while configuring Defender for Identity sensor in the next lab.

12. In the **DNS Options** tab, Click **Next**.

13. In the **Additional Options** tab, **The NetBIOS domain name** will be automatically populated and click **Next**.

14. In **Paths** tab, keep the default paths as specified for Database folder, Log files folder and SYSVOL folder and click **Next**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/dc14.png)

15. In **Review Options** tab, Review your settings and click **Next**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/dc15.png)

16. In **Prerequisites Check** tab, You will see All prerequisite checks passed successfully. Click on **Install**
