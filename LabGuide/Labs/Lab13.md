## Lab scenario
In this lab you will explore about the *Deploying Domain Controller*.

## Lab objectives (Duration: minutes)

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1.1: Configure VM with Static IP Addresses
- Task 1.1: Install Active Directory Domain Services

### Task 1: Deploy Domain Controller 

### Task 1.1 : Configure VM with Static IP Addresses

Domain controllers need a static IP address and the DNS pointing to itself. For on-premises DCs you would just go into the NIC settings and manually configure the IP settings. With Azure VMs itâ€™s recommended to set this at the Virtual Network Interface.

1. Go to **svm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /></inject>** virtual machine. In the left-hand menu for your VM under settings click on **Networking**.Now click on the Network Interface for the VM **svm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /></inject>-nic**.
2. Click on **IP Configurations** in the left menu under settings. Next click on **ipconfig1** under IP configurations.
3. Change the IP from **Dynamic** to **Static** and enter the IP address you want the domain controller to have, it must be an IP from the subnet you assigned to your virtual network like 10.0.0.4. Click **Save**.
4. Go back to the Network Interface and click on **DNS servers**. Set the DNS server to the IP address of the domain controller.

### Task 1.2 : Install Active Directory Domain Services

1. With a VM pre-created and the IP settings configured we can move forward with installing Active Directory on the server.
2. From the jump VM. Search for **Server Manager** from the start menu and select it. Go to the server manager and click on **Add roles and features**.
3. You will be directed to **Before you begin** tab. Click **Next**.
4. In the **Installation type** tab, select **Role-based or feature-based installation** and click **Next**.
5. In the **Server Selection** tab, select **Select a server from the server pool** and then select the hostname of your server i.e. **svm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /></inject>** and click **Next**.
6. Under **Server Roles** tab, select **Active Directory Domain Services**. You will get a pop-up to add additional features. Click **Add Features** then Click **Next**.
7. Now, under **Features**, you will see additional features that we can add, as no features need to be added for now so click **Next**.
8. From the **Active Directory Domain Service** tab, Click **Next**.
9. In the **Confirm installation selections** tab, Click **Install**.
10. When finished click the flag icon in the upper right corner and click on **Promote this server to a domain controller**.
11. Now a new tab will open of Deployment configuration. Click on **Add a new forest**. Under **Root domain name** provide the domain which you can find in the Environment Details tab i.e. You can use the domain name which is present after the **@** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>.
12. Under **Domain Controller Options** tab, keep the default settings and provide a DSRM password and click **Next**.
13. In the **DNS Options** tab, Click **Next**.
14. In the **Additional Options** tab, **The NetBIOS domain name** will be automatically populated and click **Next**.
15. In **Paths** tab, keep the default paths as specified for Database folder, Log files folder and SYSVOL folder and click **Next**.
16. In **Review Options** tab, Review your settings and click **Next**.
17. In **Prerequisites Check** tab, You will see All prerequisite checks passed successfully. Click on **Install**
